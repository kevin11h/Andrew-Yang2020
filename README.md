Andrew Yang Brief Biography Bite:

Andrew Yang is entrepreneur and author of 'The War on Normal People' about automation, jobs and Universal Basic Income, the founder of Venture for America, an organization that recruits and trains top college graduates to start-ups in emerging US cities to generate jobs and train future entrepreneurs. In 6 years we helped created 2,500 jobs and the work we did had me recognized by the Obama White House as a 2012 Champion of Change and a 2015 Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship. Previously Andrew was co-founder and executive at a number of start-up and early stage companies, including CEO of an education company acquired by the Washington Post/Kaplan in 2009. In 2011 he founded Venture for America, a national entrepreneurship fellowship that has helped create almost 3,000 jobs in Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and other cities throughout the country. In his book The War on Normal People, he explains the mounting crisis of the automation of labor and makes the case for the Freedom Dividend, a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month for every American as well as other policies to progress to the next stage of capitalism. Andrew was named a Presidential Ambassador of Entrepreneurship by the White House under the Obama administration and a Champion of Change for his work with Venture for America. He lives in New York City with his wife and two sons.

Andrew Yang's 2020 Campaign:

     "I’m Andrew Yang, and I’m running for President as a Democrat in 2020 because I fear for the future of our country. New technologies – robots, software, artificial intelligence – have already destroyed more than 4 million US jobs, and in the next 5-10 years, they will eliminate millions more. A third of all American workers are at risk of permanent unemployment. And this time, the jobs will not come back.

     I’m not a career politician—I’m an entrepreneur who understands the economy. It’s clear to me, and to many of the nation’s best job creators, that we need to make an unprecedented change, and we need to make it now. But the establishment isn’t willing to take the necessary bold steps. As president, my first priority will be to implement Universal Basic Income for every American adult between the ages of 18 and 64: $1,000 a month, no strings attached, paid for by a new tax on the companies benefiting most from automation. UBI is just the beginning. A crisis is underway—we have to work together to stop it, or risk losing the heart of our country. The stakes have never been higher..."

This pocket book is a primer, archive and collection of Yang2020 campaign's policy platform formatted for public educational awareness and civic literacy series knowledge product created through truly tumultuous and revolutionary times in Year 2020, in an age of AI rising and coming of the automation wave, work displacement, joblessness, global pandemic and worldwide protests, raises questions that asks the individual native citizen what does freedom really mean to us in present day American life?

How can we create and save an America of opportunity, freedom, equality, and abundance?

# Tears Joy and Sorrow

## Revelation 21:4 King James Version (KJV)

4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

## Isaiah 53:3
The Suffering Servant
…2He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no stately form or majesty to attract us, no beauty that we should desire Him. 3He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. Like one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.

Andrew Yang forewarns and presciently names in his book "The War on Normal People." Our hour of tribulation is no mere military engagement, political intrigue, nor nominal affair. 
    No, for we face a very real and present spiritual struggle which questions whether American principles of liberty, equality, and freedom will withstand the coming tempest storm of automation Armageddon: mass workforce displacement, millions unemployed, and robotic ransom of raw creativity for a cold, hollow, and unfeeling mechanistic mentality in the mind and rise of AI. The only one war is therefore the Salvation of our souls.
    Wisdom is needed to win this war. A universal, existential crisis cries out for a universal basic income solution. May knowledge of the word of UBI be your sword of justice & staff of abundance to slay the serpent of selfishness, that vanquishes its sting of poverty forever in victory! May awareness of Medicare For All be your shield of mercy and helmet of honor to bring healing for the body. May consciousness of human-centered capitalism be a breastplate of righteousness to guarantee a new currency, a new citizenship, and a new heart to our collective compassion.
   Make & take these words as your own. May the force of MATH be with us as we Make America Think Harder regarding humanity's role and place in shepherding the Heavenly Kingdom among all nations on earth.




















Faith is required to fight the battle, and wisdom is needed to win the war.

Andrew Yang forewarns and presciently names in his book "The War on Normal People." Our hour of tribulation is no mere military engagement, political intrigue, nor nominal affair. 
    No, for we face a very real and present spiritual struggle which questions whether American principles of liberty, equality, and freedom will withstand the coming tempest storm of automation Armageddon: mass workforce displacement, millions unemployed, and robotic ransom of raw creativity for a cold, hollow, and unfeeling mechanistic mentality in the mind and rise of AI. The only one war is therefore the Salvation of our souls.
      Wisdom is needed to win this war. A universal, existential crisis cries out for a universal basic income solution. May knowledge of the word of UBI be your sword of justice & staff of abundance to slay the serpent of selfishness and vanquish its sting of poverty forever in victory! May awareness of Medicare For All be your shield of mercy and helmet of honor to bring healing for the body. May consciousness of human-centered capitalism be a breastplate of righteousness to guarantee a new currency, a new citizenship, and a new heart to our collective compassion.
       Make & take these words as your own. May the force of MATH be with us as we Make America Think Harder regarding humanity's role and place in shepherding Heaven's Kingdom above all nations on earth.




















Faith is required to fight the battle, and wisdom is needed to win the war.

forewarns and presciently names in his book "The War on Normal People." Our hour of tribulation is no mere military engagement, political intrigue, nor nominal affair.
       No, for we face a very real and present spiritual struggle which questions whether foundational American principles, liberty, equality, and freedom, will withstand the coming tempest storm of automation Armageddon — brink of economic collapse, mass workforce displacement, millions unemployed, endless national protest, civil unrest, global pandemic, and the final robotic ransom of raw natural born ingenuity for The Machine — a cold, hollow, artificial and unfeeling mechanistic mentality in the mind and rise of AI. Our only ever war is therefore the Salvation of our souls.

> We now literally live a wake up call of battle that Andrew Yang forewarns and presciently names in his book "The War on Normal People." Our hour of tribulation is no mere military engagement, political intrigue, nor nominal affair.
       For we witness a very real and present spiritual struggle in the eve of the greatest economic and societal shift in the 21st century, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which questions whether foundational American pillars of liberty, equality, and freedom will withstand the next 10 years of a coming firestorm that is automation Armageddon: brink of corporate collapse, mass workforce displacement, millions in job loss, ⅓ permanent unemployment rate, global pandemic, civil unrest, endless national protest, unrelenting climate change, and the final robotic ransom of natural born ingenuity as sacrifice to "The Machine" — a cold, hollow, artificial and unfeeling, mechanistic mentality in the materialist mind of AI. Our only ever war is therefore the Salvation of our souls.
        Wisdom is needed to win this war. A universal crisis cries out for a heroic Universal Basic Income solution. May enlightenment of UBI's word be your sword of justice that slays the serpent of selfishness and the staff of abundance which vanquishes the sting of scarcity forever in victory. May awareness of Medicare For All be your shield of mercy and helmet of honor which holds the waters of wellness and brings healing to the body. May consciousness of Human Capitalism be your breastplate of righteousness that creates a new currency of courageous compassion and a new heart of entrepreneurial empathy. May the force of MATH be with us as we Make America Think Harder, regarding humanity's role and place in shepherding Heaven's Kingdom above all nations of the earth.
        Make Andrew's presidential proposals and our prayers of power mean more than metaphors, mantras, acrostics, or a list of rules. Make Yang's policy part of your own personal story. Make our dream of that bright and joyous day complete when we write each family's first UBI check of $1,000 cash payment into a pragmatic reality.
              Take this book in your hands as a ticket. Lead us all onboard a transcendental venture in seeking a fairer society, in founding a firmer, deeper, more imperishable Plymouth Rock of Promise of a new citizenship and a New America. See the revelation of "The Gardens of Democracy," a restoration of dignity and directionality as we carry love, climb the hill of hope, and move humanity forward with faith, beyond mountains of belief, together toward building a better future for our children, upon waves of progress, across the gold road of recovery, beside green pastures of prosperity, following the path of peace and truth, the tree of life.

        Make Andrew's presidential proposals and our prayers of power mean more than metaphors, mantras, acrostics, or a list of rules. Make Yang's policy part of your own personal story. Make our dream of that bright and joyous day complete when we write each family's first UBI check of $1,000 cash payment into a pragmatic reality.
              Take this book in your hands as a ticket. Lead us all onboard a transcendental venture in seeking a fairer society, in founding a firmer, deeper, more imperishable Plymouth Rock of Promise of a new citizenship and a New America. See the revelation of "The Gardens of Democracy," a restoration of dignity and directionality as we carry love, climb the hill of hope, and move humanity forward with faith, beyond mountains of belief, together toward building a better future for our children, upon the waves of progress, across the gold road of recovery, beside green pastures of prosperity, following the path of peace and truth, the tree of life.

> We now literally live a wake up call of battle that Andrew Yang forewarns and presciently names in his book "The War on Normal People." Our hour of tribulation is no mere military engagement, political intrigue, nor nominal affair.
       For we witness a very real and present spiritual struggle in the eve of the greatest economic and technological shift in the 21st century, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a possible prelude to "Our Posthuman Future," which questions whether foundational American pillars of liberty, equality, and freedom will withstand the next 10 years of a coming firestorm that is automation Armageddon: brink of corporate collapse, mass workforce displacement, millions in job loss, ⅓ permanent unemployment rate, global pandemic, civil unrest, endless national protest, unrelenting climate change, and the final robotic ransom of natural born ingenuity as sacrifice to "The Machine" — a cold, hollow, artificial and unfeeling, mechanistic mentality in the materialist mind of AI. Our only ever war is therefore the Salvation of our souls.
        Wisdom is needed to win this war. A universal crisis cries out for a heroic Universal Basic Income solution. May enlightenment of UBI's word be your sword of justice that slays the serpent of selfishness and the staff of abundance which vanquishes the sting of scarcity forever in victory. May awareness of Medicare For All be your shield of mercy and helmet of honor which holds the waters of wellness and brings healing to the body. May consciousness of Human Capitalism be your breastplate of righteousness that creates a new currency of courageous compassion and a new heart of entrepreneurial empathy. May the force of MATH be with us as we Make America Think Harder, regarding humanity's role and place in shepherding Heaven's Kingdom above all nations of the earth.
        Make Andrew's presidential proposals and our prayers of power mean more than metaphors, mantras, acrostics, or a list of rules. Make Yang's policy part of your own personal story. Make our dream of that bright and joyous day complete when we write each family's first UBI check for $1,000 cash payment into a pragmatic reality.
              Take this book in your hands as a ticket. Lead us onboard the transcendental venture in seeking a fairer society, to founding a firmer, deeper, more imperishable Plymouth Rock of Promise, of a new citizenship and a New America. See the revelation of "The Gardens of Democracy" emerge before your eyes, the restoration of dignity and directionality as we carry love, climb the hill of hope, and move humanity forward with faith, beyond mountains of belief, together toward building a better future for our children, walking upon waves and shining seas of progress, across the gold road of recovery, beside green pastures of prosperity, and following the path of peace and truth, the tree of life.
