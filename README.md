1 John 3:17, NASB: "But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?" 1 John 3:17, NLT: "If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need but shows no compassion--how can God's love be in that person?"

# Tears Joy and Sorrow

## Revelation 21:4 King James Version (KJV)

4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

![](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190810175239-andrew-yang-crying-8-10-2019-large-169.jpg)

## Isaiah 53:3
The Suffering Servant
…2He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no stately form or majesty to attract us, no beauty that we should desire Him. 3He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. Like one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.
